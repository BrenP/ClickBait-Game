# ClickBait-Game
## About
Personal project I started during the summer to help myself learn Python. This program idea was inspired by a [Video](https://youtu.be/bM_pAXi_pEQ?t=34) made by ['JacksFilms'](https://www.youtube.com/user/jacksfilms) on YouTube. The final program will focus on reaching a target tag instead of a target thumbnail/title and will show the user the fastest route possible to that target tag.

### Why 
I decided to build this specific program because it would include many packages that I wanted to learn more about. This Application includes a GUI package (TKInter) and packages, Requests and Beautiful Soup 4, to run through URL links.

## Goals
This program is currently running on a basic framework of what the game will be. There are many things to implement which mostly revolving around making the UI look better and adding target tags.

#### Short Term Goals:

	-Formatting the titles/menu to look better

	-Fix the quality of certain downloaded pictures

	-Allow a target tag

	-display tags of current video/show target tag

	-Show number of attempts

### Long Term Goals:

	-Show fastest route possible to target tag
